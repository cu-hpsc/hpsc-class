    "We have discussed the Jacobi preconditioner\n",
    "$$ P_{\\text{Jacobi}}^{-1} = D^{-1} $$\n",
    "where $D$ is the diagonal of $A$.\n",
    "Gauss-Seidel is\n",
    "$$ P_{GS}^{-1} = (L+D)^{-1} $$\n",
    "where $L$ is the (strictly) lower triangular part of $A$.  The upper triangular part may be used instead, or a symmetric form\n",

    "## Domain decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a linear operator $A : V \\to V$, suppose we have a collection of prolongation operators $P_i : V_i \\to V$.  The columns of $P_i$ are \"basis functions\" for the subspace $V_i$.  The Galerkin operator $A_i = P_i^T A P_i$ is the action of the original operator $A$ in the subspace.\n",

    "Define the subspace projection\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ S_i = P_i A_i^{-1} P_i^T A . $$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $S_i$ is a projection: $S_i^2 = S_i$\n",
    "* If $A$ is SPD, $S_i$ is SPD with respect to the $A$ inner product $x^T A y$\n",
    "* $I - S_i$ is $A$-orthogonal to the range of $P_i$\n",

    "### Examples\n",

    "* Jacobi corresponds to the additive preconditioner with $P_i$ as the $i$th column of the identity\n",
    "* Gauss-Seidel is the multiplicate preconditioner with $P_i$ as the $i$th column of the identity\n",
    "* Block Jacobi corresponds to labeling \"subdomains\" and $P_i$ as the columns of the identity corresponding to non-overlapping subdomains\n",
    "* Overlapping Schwarz corresponds to overlapping subdomains\n",
    "* $P_i$ are eigenvectors of $A$\n",
    "* A domain is partitioned into interior $V_I$ and interface $V_\\Gamma$ degrees of freedom.  $P_I$ is embedding of the interior degrees of freedom while $P_\\Gamma$ is \"harmonic extension\" of the interface degrees of freedom.  Consider the multiplicative combination $(I - S_\\Gamma)(I - S_I)$.\n",

    "### Convergence theory\n",
    "\n",
    "The formal convergence is beyond the scope of this course, but the following estimates are useful.  We let $h$ be the element diameter, $H$ be the subdomain diameter, and $\\delta$ be the overlap, each normalized such that the global domain diameter is 1.  We express the convergence in terms of the condition number $\\kappa$ for the preconditioned operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "* (Block) Jacobi: $\\delta=0$, $\\kappa \\sim H^{-2} H/h = (Hh)^{-1}$\n",
    "* Overlapping Schwarz: $\\kappa \\sim H^{-2} H/\\delta = (H \\delta)^{-1}$\n",
    "* 2-level overlapping Schwarz: $\\kappa \\sim H/\\delta$\n",
